# Hi! I'm Connor.

### :wave: About Me
I am a driven, outcome-oriented software engineer who prioritizes strong
architecture and design across all my projects. Outside of my work, I'm a person
who loves video games, music, sports, cooking, and travel. I love exploring
the world around me and learning more about it!

Some of my favorite projects over the years have combined a handful
of my passions, such as my college capstone project,
[Keyboard Hero](https://github.com/connorlucier/KeyboardHero).
I had a blast designing and implementing the game you see today,
and there is a ton of potential still yet to be discovered with
the game itself and the music/rhythm genre of games in general.

Finally, keep an eye on [B3yond Labs](https://github.com/b3yondlabs) for future
projects and product releases. I have some entrepeneurial projects in the works
that will redefine what technology can provide for developers and businesses
alike. I will also be releasing games under the B3yond umbrella going forward,
so be sure to stay tuned.

### :computer: Current Employment
Currently, I am a full-stack software engineer at
[Olo](https://www.olo.com), where I am helping build and shape the
future of the restaurant industry in our digital world. My
current and prior work experience can be seen in more detail
[here](https://github.com/connorlucier/connorlucier/blob/master/resume.pdf)
on my resume.

### :zap: Favorite Tech Stacks
Professionally, I have spent most of my time working in .NET,
using C# for back end and React on the front end. However, I am always looking
to learn new languages, frameworks and more to keep up with the times. Currently,
this has led me to Go and Rust. I look forward to using these more and more
going forward and distancing myself from the Microsoft ecosystem.

I am passionate about AWS infrastructure and utilize it wherever it makes sense in my
projects. I have strong experience using API Gateway, Lambda, SQS, SNS,
and many other AWS services and plan to continue learning and growing my expertise.

For databases, I have used SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL most frequently
for relational databases in combination with a variety of ORM libraries. In
addition, I have experience with Redis, Mongo/DocumentDB,
ElasticSearch and Redshift.

Most of the time, I have used frameworks based on
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
for React development, though I have tinkered with others like
[Next.js](https://next.js.org) as well in my spare time.
Finally, I spend a fair amount of time writing games in Unity
and Unreal Engine whenever possible in pursuit of side passion
projects. Take a look at some of my repos for more info!
